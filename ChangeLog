Release 0.2.3 - 2015-04-23

* Support merge mode for MySQL and PostgreSQL (@takumakanari++)
* Fix NullPointerException when a NULL value appears in a column to skip.


Release 0.2.2 - 2015-04-07

* Skips columns if matching column names don't exist in the target table
  rather than making the transaction failed (@libra++)
* Improved performance of embulk-output-oracle (@hito4t)
* embulk-output-oracle supports insert_method parameter.
  * "normal" uses regular JDBC INSERT statements.
  * "direct" uses the optimized direct path inserts.
  * "oci" uses direct path inserts with Oracle Call Interface (OCI). This is
  the fastest but requires native library in addition to JDBC driver.


Release 0.2.1 - 2015-03-15

* Added embulk-output-oracle (by @hito4t)


Release 0.2.0 - 2015-02-27

* Removed invalid commit and rollback calls causing exceptions at cleanup.
* jdbc: url parameter replaced driver_name, host, port, and database
parameters. If you are using jdbc input plugin, you need to rewrite config
file as following:

Old configuration:

  driver_class: com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
  driver_name: db2
  host: localhost
  port: 50000
  database: mydb

New configuration:

  driver_class: com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
  url: jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/mydb
